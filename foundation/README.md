## Welcome to the Foundation branch!

Congratulations on completing your bootcamp journey. This achievement reflects your commitment to becoming a Software Engineer. Ahead lies more learning and challenges that demand consistency and curiosity – you've got this!

In this branch, you’ll explore the following topics:
→ Bits and bytes
→ Algorithms and Data Structures
→ I/O: Files
→ Data Representation: Binary, JSON, Base64
→ Internet: HTTP, REST API
→ Networking Basics
→ Concurrency and Parallelism
→ Software Design Principles
→ Testing and TDD

## Program Structure

The Foundation program consists of a sequence of core and side projects. These tracks are studied one after the other:

- **Core Projects**: Need to be finished before you can move on to the next project.
- **Side Projects**: You can complete these in any order or skip them if you prefer. Doing them earns you extra XP and adds to your portfolio.

When you finish the whole program, you'll get a certificate and can move on to the next branch.

## Projects and Deadlines

### Types of Projects

Projects can be either group or individual:

- **Most of the track's projects are group projects**. If the core project is a group project, all its side projects are completed by the same team.

### Completion Deadlines

- **Completion time** for a core project ranges from one to three weeks from the start date.
- **Soft deadline**: You can continue working on the project after this deadline, but the maximum XP earned is halved.
- **Hard deadline (Judgment Day)**: By this date, all core projects and half of the side projects must be completed. Failure to meet this deadline results in blocked progress and dismissal from the course.

**Example:**
>- The first project of the track opens on September 1.
>- Judgment Day is December 1. By this date, you must submit 5/5 core projects and 10/20 side projects.
>- The deadline for the first project is one week. If you complete it by September 8, you earn 100% XP; after that, only 50%.

## Project Reviews

### Review Process

A project is considered completed if it gets a pass from more than 51% of the reviewers. The number of reviewers depends on the project's complexity.

**Example:**
>- For a simple project with two reviewers, both must approve (2/2).
>- For a project with three reviewers, two out of three approvals are needed (2/3).

### Internal Currency: Review-Coins

- For each review you conduct, you earn 1 review-coin.
- Submitting a project requires spending review-coins (equal to the number of required reviews). For instance, if a project needs 3 reviews, submitting it costs 3 review-coins.
- The review cost of group projects is split among team members. For example, if the review cost is 3 review-coins and there are 3 team members, each member spends one review-coin.

### Booking Review Time

You need to reserve specific times for conducting reviews. If you don't book a time slot, you won't be assigned as a reviewer.

When scheduled for a review, you will be assigned to assess your peer’s project. You must begin the review within 15 minutes of the scheduled time. If you fail to do so, the student can report a "no show," and another reviewer will be assigned. In this case, you won't earn any Review Coins.

### Appeals

You can appeal if you disagree with the reviewers' feedback. Appeals are reviewed by the Alem team:

- The cost of an appeal is double (2 review-coins for one review).
- The Alem team's decision is final and can’t be appealed.

## Assessment criteria and XP

A project is considered complete when it receives a pass from more than 51% of the reviewers (the number of reviewers depends on the complexity of the project).

For example, if the project is simple and has two reviewers, both reviewers (2/2) must approve the project for it to pass. If there are three reviewers, a pass is achieved with approvals from 2 out of 3 reviewers.

### How Pass/Fail is Determined

During the review process, reviewers follow specific criteria. These criteria are formulated as statements that can be answered in a binary manner (yes/no, completed/missing).

Evaluation criteria are divided into general and project-specific categories.

### **General criteria**

**General criteria** remain constant across all projects:

- Your code MUST be written in accordance with gofumpt. If not, you will automatically receive a grade of 0.
- Your program MUST be able to compile successfully.
- Your program MUST not exit unexpectedly (e.g., nil-pointer dereference, index out of range). If it does, you will receive a grade of 0 during the defense.
- Only built-in packages are allowed. If not, you will receive a grade of 0.
- The project MUST be compiled using the following command in the project's root directory.

General criteria are crucial for project evaluation. If any of these criteria are violated at any review stage, the project receives **a critical failure**, ending the review.

If at least one reviewer marks a violation of any of these criteria, the entire project is marked as a critical failure and must be restarted.

No points are awarded for meeting general criteria.

### Project-specific criteria

Project-specific criteria contribute to the overall score calculation.

For example, if a project has 10 specific criteria and a maximum of 5000 XP, the student earns 500 XP for each criterion met.

The reviewer's final verdict, based on the evaluation of the solution presentation and answers to questions, plays an important role in the assessment. If the final verdict is PASS, the student receives 100% of the XP gained by meeting the project-specific criteria. If the final verdict is FAIL, the project receives only 30% of the XP from that reviewer.

**IMPORTANT!** Distinguish between **a critical failure** (related to general project requirements, where no points are awarded and the project is sent for restart) and a presentation fail (the reviewer's subjective assessment based on the student's answers and presentation).

If the project receives the required number of passes from other reviewers, a presentation fail may not prevent the project from receiving a final pass.

### Final XP Calculation

For individual projects, the final XP is calculated as the average of all reviewers' scores (provided none of them marked a critical failure).

For example, if a project is reviewed by three reviewers with a maximum XP of 3000:

- The first reviewer gives a PASS and 2800 XP.
- The second reviewer gives a PASS and 2300 XP.
- The third reviewer gives a FAIL and thus 630 XP.

The project receives a final pass because 2 out of 3 reviewers marked it as PASS (more than 51%) and an average XP of 1910 XP ((2800 + 2300 + 630) / 3).

For group projects, all the same steps apply, plus the student's contribution is assessed based on feedback from their teammates. A student who receives a low score from their peers may receive only 70% of the project's total XP, resulting in 1337 XP.

If you complete the project after the deadline, the final XP is halved.

### Restarting the project

If your project doesn't get enough passes, you need to restart it, fix the issues and resubmit it, which will cost additional review-coins.

You will find more information in your student map card, and do not hesitate to ask questions on Discord.

Stay curious, stay engaged, and enjoy your programming journey. Welcome again, and let’s start this exciting adventure!
