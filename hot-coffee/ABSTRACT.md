## Abstract

In this project, you will build a **coffee shop management system**.

Similar projects are used by businesses to work in a competitive environment and make a profit.
This application will simulate the backend of a coffee shop's ordering system, allowing users to create, modify, close, and delete orders. Additionally, it will manage other data like menu items and inventory.

This project will teach you one of the best ways to turn business logic into code and make that code easily maintainable and scalable.
