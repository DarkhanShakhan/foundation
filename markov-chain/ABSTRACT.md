## Abstract

In this project you will build a text generator using Markov Chain algorithm.

Similar algorithms are used in your phones. For example, when you type a word in the 
keyboard it suggests you the next the most probable word.

This project teaches you that before starting writing code you should consider what your
data-structures will be, how would you store your data and only then think of your code.
