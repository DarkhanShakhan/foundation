# A Library for Others

## Learning Objectives

- File Handling in Go
- CSV Parsing
- Interfaces
- Error Handling

## Abstract

Welcome to your next project! This assignment is not just about writing code; it's a crucial step in your journey to becoming a software engineer. You will implement methods for a new library, focusing on several key principles of design and development.

Here's what you'll focus on:

- Go Interfaces: Interfaces in Go act as contracts between supplier and customer. You will use them to create a user-friendly library that simplifies handling CSV files. The goal is to provide consistent and convenient services that are easy to use without being too complex.
- Implement Parsing: You will develop the skills needed to parse complex data structures.
- Information Hiding: Determine what information should be visible and what should remain private. A well-designed interface keeps things simple for users by hiding the complex details, so changes can be made without disrupting them.
- Resource Management: Understand who is responsible for managing memory and other limited resources.
- Error Handling: When working with files and parsing, a major challenge could be managing errors. Determine who detects errors, who reports them, and how they are reported. Establish a clear process for recovery when an error is detected.

This project will provide hands-on experience in file manipulation and parsing. You will not only learn to manually process CSV data but also gain experience in designing and working with interfaces.
