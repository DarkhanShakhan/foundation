# Abstract

In this project, you will develop a tool called `triple-s`, designed to implement a simplified version of S3 (Simple Storage Service) object storage. This tool will provide a REST API that allows clients to interact with the storage system, offering core functionalities such as creating and managing buckets, uploading, retrieving, and deleting files, as well as handling object metadata. The project aims to demonstrate key concepts of RESTful API design, basic networking, and data management, providing a practical foundation for understanding cloud storage solutions.
